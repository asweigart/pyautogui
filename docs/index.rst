Welcome to PyAutoGUI's documentation!
=====================================


PyAutoGUI provide a cross-platform Python module for GUI automation. PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other desktop applications. The API is designed to be as simple as possible with sensible defaults.

    pip install pyautogui

The source is available on: https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui

PyAutoGUI has several features:

* Moving the mouse and clicking or typing in the windows of other applications.
* Take screenshots, and given an image (for example, of a button or checkbox), find it on the screen.
* Locate an application's window, and move, resize, maximize, minimize, or close it (Windows-only, currently)
* Display message boxes for user interaction while your GUI automation script runs.


For a quick example of what PyAutoGUI is capable of, here's a YouTube video of a bot automatically playing the game Sushi Go Round.

Examples
========

.. code:: python

    >>> import pyautogui
    >>> screenWidth, screenHeight = pyautogui.size() # Get the size of the primary monitor.
    >>> currentMouseX, currentMouseY = pyautogui.position() # Get the XY position of the mouse.
    >>> pyautogui.moveTo(100, 150) # Move the mouse to XY coordinates.
    >>> pyautogui.click()          # Click the mouse.
    >>> pyautogui.click(100, 200)  # Move the mouse to XY coordinates and click it.
    >>> pyautogui.click('button.png') # Find where button.png appears on the screen and click it.
    >>> pyautogui.move(0, 10)      # Move mouse 10 pixels down from its current position.
    >>> pyautogui.doubleClick()    # Double click the mouse.
    >>> pyautogui.moveTo(500, 500, duration=2, tween=pyautogui.easeInOutQuad)  # Use tweening/easing function to move mouse over 2 seconds.
    >>> pyautogui.write('Hello world!', interval=0.25)  # type with quarter-second pause in between each key
    >>> pyautogui.press('esc')     # Press the Esc key. All key names are in pyautogui.KEY_NAMES
    >>> pyautogui.keyDown('shift') # Press the Shift key down and hold it.
    >>> pyautogui.press(['left', 'left', 'left', 'left']) # Press the left arrow key 4 times.
    >>> pyautogui.keyUp('shift')   # Let go of the Shift key.
    >>> pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'c') # Press the Ctrl-C hotkey combination.
    >>> pyautogui.alert('Hello, world!') # Make an alert box appear and pause the program until OK is clicked.

This example drags the mouse in a square spiral shape in MS Paint (or any graphics drawing program):

.. code:: python

    >>> distance = 200
    >>> while distance > 0:
            pyautogui.drag(distance, 0, duration=0.5)   # move right
            distance -= 5
            pyautogui.drag(0, distance, duration=0.5)   # move down
            pyautogui.drag(-distance, 0, duration=0.5)  # move left
            distance -= 5
            pyautogui.drag(0, -distance, duration=0.5)  # move up

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Send questions to <a href="mailto:al@inventwithpython.com">al@inventwithpython.com</a>

**Q: Can PyAutoGUI work on Android, iOS, or tablet/smartphone apps.**

A: Unfortunately no. PyAutoGUI only runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Q: Does PyAutoGUI work on multi-monitor setups.**

A: No, right now PyAutoGUI only handles the primary monitor.

**Q: Does PyAutoGUI do OCR?**

A: No, but this is a feature that's on the roadmap.


Fail-Safes
==========

.. image:: sorcerers_apprentice_brooms.png

Like the enchanted brooms from the Sorcererâ€™s Apprentice programmed to keep filling (and then overfilling) the bath with water, a bug in your program could make go out of control. If the mouse is moving around on its own, you could be prevent from clicking on the program's window to close it down.

As a safety feature, a fail-safe feature is enabled by default. When a PyAutoGUI function is called, if the mouse is in any of the four corners of the primary monitor, they will raise a ``pyautogui.FailSafeException``. There is also a one-tenth second delay after calling PyAutoGUI functions to give the user time to slam the mouse into a corner to trigger the fail safe.

You can disable this failsafe by setting ``pyautogui.FAILSAFE = False``. **I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT DISABLE THE FAILSAFE.**
