Installation
============

To install PyAutoGUI, install the `pyautogui` package from PyPI and dependencies.

On Windows, this is:

    C:\\Python34\\pip.exe install pyautogui

(Though you may have a different version of Python installed other than 3.4)

On OS X, this is:

    sudo pip3 install pyobjc-core

    sudo pip3 install pyobjc

    sudo pip3 install pyautogui

On Linux, this is:

    sudo pip3 install python3-xlib

    sudo apt-get scrot

    sudo apt-get install python-tk

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev

    sudo pip3 install pyautogui

PyAutoGUI will try to install Pillow (for its screenshot capabilities). This happens when pip installs PyAutoGUI.
