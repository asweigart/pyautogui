Installation
============

To install PyAutoGUI, install the `pyautogui` package from PyPI and dependencies.

On Windows, this is:

    C:\Python34\pip.exe install pyautogui

(Though you may have a different version of Python installed other than 3.4)

On OS X, this is:

    sudo pip3 install pyobjc-core

    sudo pip3 install pyobjc

    sudo pip3 install pyautogui

On Linux, this is:

    sudo apt-get install python-tk

    sudo pip3 install python3-Xlib

    sudo pip3 install pyautogui

(python-tk is required only for Python 2.x, since it does not come with the tkinter module that the message box features use.)
