    This function takes one of ``LEFT``, ``MIDDLE``, ``RIGHT``, ``PRIMARY``, ``SECONDARY``, ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, ``4``,

    The ``'left'`` and ``'right'`` mouse buttons will always refer to the physical left and right
    buttons on the mouse. The same applies for buttons 1 and 3.

    the mouse buttons have been "swapped" (for left-handed users) by the operating system's mouse

    commands that represent PyAutoGUI function calls.

    For example, `run('ccg-20,+0c')` clicks the mouse twice, then makes
    the mouse cursor go 20 pixels to the left, then click again.

    Whitespace between commands and arguments is ignored. Command characters
    must be lowercase. Quotes must be single quotes.

    For example, the previous call could also be written as `run('c c g -20, +0 c')`.

    The character commands and their equivalents are here:

    `c` => `click(button=PRIMARY)`
    `l` => `click(button=LEFT)`
    `m` => `click(button=MIDDLE)`
    `r` => `click(button=RIGHT)`
    `su` => `scroll(1) # scroll up`
    `sd` => `scroll(-1) # scroll down`
    `ss` => `screenshot('screenshot1.png') # filename number increases on its own`

    `gX,Y` => `moveTo(X, Y)`
    `g+X,-Y` => `move(X, Y) # The + or - prefix is the difference between move() and moveTo()`
    `dX,Y` => `dragTo(X, Y)`
    `d+X,-Y` => `drag(X, Y) # The + or - prefix is the difference between drag() and dragTo()`

    `k'key'` => `press('key')`
    `w'text'` => `write('text')`
    `h'key,key,key'` => `hotkey(*'key,key,key'.replace(' ', '').split(','))`
    `a'hello'` => `alert('hello')`

    `sN` => `sleep(N) # N can be an int or float`
    `pN` => `PAUSE = N # N can be an int or float`

    `fN(commands)` => for i in range(N): run(commands)
